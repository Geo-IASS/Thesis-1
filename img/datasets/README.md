# Plots
This directory contains plots of the raw
[datasets](https://github.com/joshuaspence/Thesis/tree/master/data/datasets)
which were used in this Thesis. The plots were produced by MATLAB and are stored
as PNG files.

# Scripts
In addition, this directory contains scripts with a name `DATASET.png.pl` (which
all symlink to the `common.pl` script), which can be used to regenerate the PNG
plots. This should rarely need to be done, but is included here for
completeness.

Data sets with more than 3 dimensions are plotted by using only data from the
first three dimensions of the data set.
