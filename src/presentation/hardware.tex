% Design
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% In this section, illustrate the hardware and software interface for the
% design. Note that the most important part of the hardware design is
% parallelism, so it is important to mention how this was achieved.

\begin{frame}[label=performance-considerations]{Performance Considerations}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Cannot be data transfer faster than $O(n)$
        \item For each vector that is pruned from the block, we save (on
            average) $\frac{block\_size}{2}$ distance computations
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[label=performance-estimates]{Performance Estimates}
    The execution time for the proposed design is estimated to be the sum of:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item<1-> Execution time of software implementation, excluding the
            distance\_squared function
        \item<2-> Time required for DMA transfer of ``outer'' vector.
        \item<3-> Time required for DMA transfer of ``inner'' vector, plus the time
            required for the hardware to complete the computation and return the
            result
        \item<4-> Overheads associated with thread management
    \end{enumerate}
