% Design
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% In this section, illustrate the hardware and software interface for the
% design. Note that the most important part of the hardware design is
% parallelism, so it is important to mention how this was achieved.
