\subsection{Overview}
\begin{frame}[label=overview]{Overview}
    \begin{itemize}
        \note{In this presentation, I will discuss the works and results of my
            Thesis project, which was conducted during the year of 2012 under
            the supervision of \supervisorName{}, and with assistance from PhD
            student \getPerson{Frechtling}.}

        \item Analysis and benchmarking of an anomaly detection algorithm.
        \note[item]{I will provide an overview of my analysis and benchmarking
            of an existing anomaly detection algorithm. This algorithm...}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Uses commute time as a distance metric.
            \note[item]{Uses commute time as a distance metric. Commute time
                effectively captures both the distance between nodes, as well as
                the data density around these nodes.}

            \item Uses eigenspace embedding.
            \note[item]{The use of Eigenspace embedding alleviates the $O(n^3)$
                computational complexity of the commute time calculations.}
            \note[item]{The graph components are sampled in order to reduce the
                graph size, and then Eigenspace approximation is applied to
                approximate the commute time on the sampled graph.}

            \item Run time (using \emph{approximated} commute time) is
                proportional to $O(n \log n)$, compared to:
            \note[item]{}
            \begin{itemize}
                \item $O(n)$ using Euclidean distance.
                \note[item]{}

                \item $O(n^2)$ using \gls{LOF}.
                \note[item]{}
            \end{itemize}

            \item Anomaly detection using \emph{approximated} commute time
                preserves a high percentage (84.6\% on average) of top anomalies
                discovered without using approximations.
            \note[item]{}
        \end{itemize}

        \item Discussion of the use of \glspl{FPGA}.
        \note[item]{\glspl{FPGA} are devices that combine the advantages of
            hardware implementations (speed) with the flexibility of software
            implementations (configurability).}

        \item Exploration of the use of reconfigurable computing to solve
            computing problems.
        \note[item]{Reconfigurable computing is the application of \glspl{FPGA}
            to solve computing problems.}
