\subsection{Aims}
% This section should be short and memorable.
\begin{frame}{Aims}
    The aim of this \thesis{} is to investigate the performance benefits that
    can be obtained by applying reconfigurable computing design principles to an
    anomaly detection algorithm using commute time and Eigenspace sampling.
