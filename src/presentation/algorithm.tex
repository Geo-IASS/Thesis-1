    \note{This slide shows a short animation, illustrating the execution of the
    chosen anomaly detection method on a data set of 441 2-dimensional
    vectors.

    In this animation, the yellow points indicate the current block that is
    being processed. Each vector within the block is compared to all other
    vectors in the data set, illustrated by the blue marker in the animation.

    Each vector in the current block is given a score, a monotonic decreasing
    function that provides a heuristic to estimate if any given vector may be an
    outlier.

    The current `best' outliers are highlighted in green in the animation. As
    the algorithm processes further blocks of data, the set of current outliers
    converges to the final set of outliers.

    If the score for any vector in the current block becomes less than the
    lowest score from the set of current outliers, then this vector is no longer
    considered to be a possible outlier, and is pruned from the data set. The
    pruned vectors appear in red in the animation.}
