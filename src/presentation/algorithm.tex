\subsection{The Algorithm}
\begin{frame}[label=algorithm]{The Algorithm}
        {Anomaly Detection Using Commute Time}\relax
    {\tiny
        \begin{algorithm}[H]
            \input{chapter02/anomaly-detection_commute-time.algm}
        \end{algorithm}}

    \note{The $k$-nearest neighbour graph with $n$ nodes is built in
        $O(n \log n)$ using kd-tree with the assumption that the dimensionality
        of the data is not very high. The average degree of each node is $O(k)$
        ($k << n$). So the graph is sparse and thus finding connected components
        takes $O(kn)$.

        After sampling, the size of graph is $O(n_s)$ ($n_s << n$). The standard
        method for eigen decomposition of $L_s$ is $O(n_s^3)$. Since $L_s$ is
        sparse, it would take $O(Nn_s) = O(kn_s^2)$, where $N$ is the number of
        nonzeros. The computation of just the $m$ smallest eigenvectors
        ($m < n_s$) is less expensive than that.

        The typical distance-based anomaly detection takes $O(n_s^2)$ for the
        neighbourhood search. Pruning can scale it nearly linear. We only need
        to compute the commute times $O(n_s)$ times, each of which takes $O(m)$.
        So the time needed for two steps is proportional to
        $O(n \log n + kn + kn_s^2 + mn_s) = O(n \log n)$ as $n_s << n$.}

    \note{This slide shows a short animation, illustrating the execution of the
        chosen anomaly detection method on a data set of 441 2-dimensional
        vectors.

        In this animation, the yellow points indicate the current block that is
        being processed. Each vector within the block is compared to all other
        vectors in the data set, illustrated by the blue marker in the
        animation.

        Each vector in the current block is given a score, a monotonic
        decreasing function that provides a heuristic to estimate if any given
        vector may be an outlier.

        The current `best' outliers are highlighted in green in the animation.
        As the algorithm processes further blocks of data, the set of current
        outliers converges to the final set of outliers.

        If the score for any vector in the current block becomes less than the
        lowest score from the set of current outliers, then this vector is no
        longer considered to be a possible outlier, and is pruned from the data
        set. The pruned vectors appear in red in the animation.}
