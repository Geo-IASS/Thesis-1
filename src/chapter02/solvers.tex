\nocite{Spielman:2006}
Spielman and Teng presented a randomised algorithm that, on input a symmetric,
weakly diagonally dominant $n \times x$ matrix $A$ with $m$ non-zero entries and
an $n$-vector $\mathbf{b}$, produces an $\tilde{\mathbf{x}}$ such that
$\begin{Vmatrix} \tilde{\textbf{x}} - A^\dagger \textbf{b} \end{Vmatrix}_A
\leq \epsilon \begin{Vmatrix} A^\dagger \mathbf{b} \end{Vmatrix}_A$ in expected
time:
\begin{equation}
    m \log^{O(1)} n \log(1/\epsilon)
\end{equation}
