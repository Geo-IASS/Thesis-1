Distance is a quantitative description of how far apart two objects are.
Mathematically, a distance or metric is a function describing how close or far
away data points in some space are from each other \cite{Khoa:2012}.

% Euclidean Distance
\subsection{Euclidean Distance}
\label{distance:euclidian}
An Euclidean distance between two data points in a space is the norm of the
difference between two vectors corresponding to these data points
\cite{Khoa:2012}. Euclidean distance is extremely sensitive to the scale of the
features involved. When dealing with features of vastly different scales, the
effects of the larger feature dominant over the smaller feature in terms of the
Euclidean distance. This problem is usually solved by normalizing the data
values. Another issue, however, with Euclidean distance is that it is unable to
take into account any correlation between data features.

% Mahalanobis Distance
\subsection{Mahalanobis Distance}
\label{distance:mahalanobis}
Mahalanobis distance is a distance measure that considers the covariance between
data features. Mahalanobis distance, however, is extremely sensitive to
anomalies as anomalies affect both the mean and the covariance of the data.
