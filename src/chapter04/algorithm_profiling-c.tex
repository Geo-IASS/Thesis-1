\subsection{Results}
\label{software:algorithmProfiling:c:results}
This section details the results of profiling the initial \progLang{C}
implementation of the \command{TopN_Outlier_Pruning_Block} function across
numerous data sets. The following plots compare the self execution time of
sub-functions that are called during the execution of the
\command{TopN_Outlier_Pruning_Block} function.

The data for the plots was obtained using \software{The GNU Profiler}[gprof].
Descriptions of the data sets can be found in \autoref{dataSets}.

Please note that in the following plots, any functions with a self time less
than 1\% of the total execution time have been aggregated and are represented in
the plots by ``Other''.
