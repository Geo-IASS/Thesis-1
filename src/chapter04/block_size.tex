\label{software:blockSize:profiling}
This section details the results of profiling the initial \progLang{C}
implementation of the \command{TopN_Outlier_Pruning_Block} function across
numerous data sets, and with a varying block size. In addition, the execution
time of the algorithm was compared with a modified implementation which does not
use blocking in any way.

The data for the plots was obtained using the \software{MATLAB}
\command{profile} command. Descriptions of the data sets can be found in
\autoref{dataSets}.

Please note that the legend in \autoref{blockSizeProfiling:legend} is common to
all of the figures in this section (i.e.\
\autoref{blockSizeProfiling:totalExecutionTime},
\autoref{blockSizeProfiling:functionExecutionTime},
\autoref{blockSizeProfiling:distanceCalls},
\autoref{blockSizeProfiling:vectorsPruned},
\autoref{blockSizeProfiling:totalRunTimeComplexity} and
\autoref{blockSizeProfiling:functionRunTimeComplexity}).
