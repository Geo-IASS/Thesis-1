% ALGORITHM PROFILING
\section{Algorithm Profiling}
\label{sec:algorithmProfiling}
In order to choose which step of the algorithm would be best suited for 
implementation on FPGA hardware, it was first necessary to first profile the 
execution of the algorithm using various test cases. This task was performed 
using \emph{MATLAB}, using code supplied by \citeauthor{Khoa:2012} that was used
to test and verify the conclusions of \citetitle{Khoa:2012}. Using 
\emph{MATLAB}'s \verb+profile+ command, I was able to analyse the algorithm and 
make an assessment of the running time of the algorithm.
