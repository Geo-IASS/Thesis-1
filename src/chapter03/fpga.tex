\subsection{Introduction}
\label{fpga:Introduction}
In the two decades since \glspl{FPGA} were introduced, they have radically
changed the way digital logic is designed and deployed \cite{Hauck:2007}.
\glspl{FPGA} are revolutionary devices that offer a compromise between the
flexibility and ease of microprocessor-based software designs; and the
performance and efficiency of \gls{ASIC}-based hardware design. Unlike an
\gls{ASIC}, computations are programmed into the \gls{FPGA} device, instead of
being permanently constructed during the manufacturing process. This means that
an \gls{FPGA} device can be programmed and reprogrammed ny times, allowing for
a significant level of flexibility whilst enabling a much faster and efficient
implementation than a software equivalent.

These benefits, however, do not come without a cost. Designing an
\gls{FPGA}-based system is a more complicated process than the development of a
software process. In order to effectively utilise hardware resources, the
designer of an \gls{FPGA}-based system must consider the hardware resources that
are provided by the \gls{FPGA} device, and must remain flexible during the
design process so as to utilise as many of the hardware resources that are
available whilst ensuring that the highest level of performance is obtained.
These considerations are seldom necessary in a pure-software approach, as tools
such as compilers and assemblers abstract the hardware implementation details
away from the developers in order to provide cross-system and, often,
cross-architecture compatability.

Compared to an \gls{ASIC} design, which may take many months or years to design
and have a multimillion-dollar price tag, an \gls{FPGA} design might only take
days to create and cost tens to hundreds of dollars \cite{Hauck:2007}.

\end{figure}

\autoref{fig:fpga:abstract} shows an abstract view of an \gls{FPGA}, which
consists of an \emph{array} of logic blocks (\emph{gates}) connected in a
general routing structure. THe logic blocks contains processing elements for
impleenting combinatorial logic, as well as flip-flops for implementing
sequential logic. The logic and routing elments of an \gls{FPGA} are controlled
by programming points, which may be based on anitfuse, Flash  or \gls{SRAM}
technology. With the corresponding memory bits programmed, by way of a
configuration file or a bitstream, an \gls{FPGA} can be made to implement the
user's desired function. For this reason, glspl{FPGAs} are referred to as
\emph{field progammable} devices, as opposed to \emph{mask programmable}
devices, which have their  functionality fixed by masks during fabrication.

The design of an \gls{FPGA} program typically begins with an algorithm expressed
in a \gls{HDL} such as Verilog or \gls{VHDL}. An \gls{FPGA} design goes through
several development phases \cite{Hauck:2007}:
\begin{description}
    \item[Logic synthesis] Converts high level logic constructs and behavioural
        code into gates.
    \item[Technology mapping] Separate the gates into groupings that best match
        the \gls{FPGA}'s logic resources.
    \item[Placement] Assigns the logic groupings to specific logic blocks.
    \item[Routing] Determines the interconnect resources that will carry the
        user's signals.
    \item[Bitstream generation] Creates a binary file that sets all of the
        \gls{FPGA}'s programming points to configure the logic blocks and
        routing resources appropriately.
\end{description}

\subsection{Device Architecture}
\label{fpga:deviceArchitecture}
Fundamentally, an \gls{FPGA} device consists of a large array of logic elements
(logic blocks) together with an interconnection network to pass data between
different logic blocks. A simplified representation illustrating the placement
of logic blocks and interconnections is shown in
\autoref{fig:fpga:architecture}.

\end{figure}

% Logic Elements
\subsubsection{Logic Blocks}
\label{fpga:deviceArchitecture:logicBlocks}
Logic blocks are the fundamental component of any \gls{FPGA} architecture and
are made to realize a single logic function using a \gls{LUT} and a flip-flop.
The \glspl{LUT} provide the functional mapping between the logic block's input
and output bits. The flip-flop is a necessary sequential logic device for the
logic block to maintain a state. Almost all commercial \glspl{FPGA} have settled
on a \gls{LUT} as their basic building block \cite{Hauck:2007}.

From a circuit implementation perspective, a \gls{LUT} can be formed using a
$N:1$ multiplexer and an $N$-bit memory. In this implementation, the multiplier
simply maps some input combination of bits to some output combination of bits.
An important design consideration for an \gls{FPGA} is both the size of each
\gls{LUT} as well as the number of \glspl{LUT} that comprise a logic block.
These design considerations form the \emph{computational granularity} of the
\gls{FPGA}. Smaller (\emph{fine-grained}) \glspl{LUT} can effectively be used to
compute arithmetic and bit-level functions, but must be combined together in
order to realize more complicated functions. Larger (\emph{coarse-grained})
\glspl{LUT}, on the other hand, are capable of handling complicated logic
functions, at the cost of wasting logic resources when used to implement simple
logic functions.

% The Array and Interconnect
\subsubsection{The Array and Interconnect}
\label{fpga:deviceArchitecture:arrayAndInterconnect}
Whilst the logic block is the fundamental component of an \gls{FPGA}, there is a
requirement for an interconnection network to allow data to flow between
adjacent (and possibly non-adjacent) logic blocks. This interconnection network
is known as the interconnect, and is a routing network that is configured to
route signals between logic blocks appropriately. Using this general design,
with enough logic blocks it is possible to perform any desired computation
\cite{Hauck:2007}.

Note that the interconnect structure shown in \autoref{fig:fpga:architecture} is
not representative of any actual interconnect structure that is currently in
use, but rather acts as a placeholder for visual demonstration. In reality,
there are a wide range of metholdologies relating to \gls{FPGA} interconnect
structure. Some of the more common configurations are described below.
\begin{description}
    \item[Nearest neighbour] Arguably the simplest interconnect structure, in
        which a logic block can communicate only with its immediate neighbours.
    \item[Segmented] A more generic and mesh-like interconnect structure. A
        logic block accesses nearby communication resources through a connection
        block, which itself allows logic block inputs and outputs to be assigned
        to arbitrary horizontal and vertical tracks. In addition, switch blocks
        connect converging routing tracks, allowing a signal on one track to
        communicate with a singal on another track.
    \item[Hierarchical] At the lowest level of the hierarchy, $2 \times 2$
        arrays of logic blocks are grouped together to form a single cluster.
        Within each cluster, only nearest-neighbour routing available. At each
        increasing levfel of the hierarchical interconnect structure, larger
        logic block clusters are formed. This interconnect structure exploits
        the property that a well-designed and well-placed circuit has mostly
        local connections and only a limited number fo connections that need to
        travel long distances \cite{Hauck:2007}.
