In the computer and electronics world, computations are performed either in
hardware or in software. Computer hardware provides highly optimized resources
for quickly performing critical tasks, but is permanently configured to a single
task or application. Computer software offers a flexible approach, but is orders
of magnitude worse than a hardware implementation in terms of performance,
silicon area efficiency and power consumption.

\glspl{FPGA} are devices that combine the advantages of hardware implementations
with the flexibility of software implementations. The computations are
programmed into the silicon chip such that an FPGA system can be programmed and
reprogrammed many times. The utility of FPGAs does, however, come at a price.
Whilst, compared to a microprocessor, FPGAs are typically several orders of
magnitude faster and more power efficient, the task of creating efficient
programs for these devices is difficult.

Typically, \glspl{FPGA} are useful only for operations that process large
streams of data, such as signal processing, networking, and the like. Compared
to integrated circuit, they may be 5 to 25 times worse in terms of area, delay,
and performance \cite{Hauck:2007}. However, while an integrated circuit design
may take months to years to develop and have a multimillion-dollar price tag, an
\gls{FPGA} design might only take days to create and cost tens to hundreds of
dollars.
