\subsection{High Level Synthesis}
\label{hls}
High level synthesis is a process which is able to transform a design
specification from a low-level programming language (such as C, C++ or SystemC)
into an \gls{RTL} implementation. In particular, this thesis will focus on the
\software{Xilinx AutoESL} High Level Synthesis tool.

The design flow of AutoESL comprises three major stages \cite{XILINX:Tutorial}:
\begin{description}
    \item[Synthesis] Creates an \gls{RTL} implemenetation from the source code.
    \item[Simulation] Verifies the \gls{RTL} through co-simulation with a test
        bench.
    \item[Implementation] Generates and executes scripts to perform logic
        analysis.
\end{description}
