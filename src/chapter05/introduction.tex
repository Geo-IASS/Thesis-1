In this chapter, I propose and discuss several possible hardware implementations
for the \algm{anomaly detection using commute distance} algorithm. For each of
the proposed hardware implementations, I discuss

The \gls{FPGA} that was used throughout this \thesis{} was the \Xilinx{}
Z7020CLG484-1. Information and specifications regarding this device can be found
in \autoref{specs:fpga}.
